# Next.js rules

## data fetching paradigm:

- use server components for data fetching, include all types of content, dynamic or static
- dynamic content: data queries from databases, personalized data, data related to params and search params
- static content: texts, labels, which icons

## interactivity

- use client components only for interactions: event handlers, local state, browser APIs, browser state (mouse position, scroll position, screen size)
- client components should never include dynamic or static content as described above

## react 19

- avoid using forwardRef, ref is a part of props already
